# Django Allauth Social Login Setup Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up Google, GitHub, and Microsoft OAuth authentication for your Django vinyl record shop.

## üîß Installation Complete

The django-allauth package has been installed and configured with:
- Google authentication
- GitHub authentication  
- Microsoft authentication

## üìã OAuth Application Setup Required

Before social login will work, you need to create OAuth applications with each provider and configure them in Django admin.

### 1. Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Navigate to APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen
4. Configure consent screen:
   - User Type: External
   - App name: "Vinyl Record House"
   - User support email: Your email
   - Scopes: Add `profile` and `email`
5. Go to APIs & Services > Credentials
6. Create credentials > OAuth client ID
7. Application type: Web application
8. Authorized redirect URIs (‚ö†Ô∏è **MUST BE EXACT**):
   - `http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/google/login/callback/`
   - `http://localhost:8000/accounts/google/login/callback/`
   
   **Troubleshooting**: If you get "redirect_uri_mismatch" error:
   - Double-check the URL matches exactly (including trailing slash)
   - Make sure you're accessing your site via the same domain (127.0.0.1 vs localhost)
   - Wait a few minutes after saving for Google's changes to propagate
9. Save the Client ID and Client Secret

### 2. GitHub OAuth Setup

1. Go to [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
2. Register a new OAuth App:
   - Application name: "Vinyl Record House"
   - Homepage URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
   - Authorization callback URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/github/login/callback/`
3. Save the Client ID and Client Secret

### 3. Microsoft OAuth Setup

1. Go to [Azure App Registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)
2. New registration:
   - Name: "Vinyl Record House"
   - Supported account types: "Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts"
   - Redirect URI: Web: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/microsoft/login/callback/`
3. Go to Certificates & secrets > New client secret
4. Save the Application (client) ID and Client Secret value

## üõ†Ô∏è Django Admin Configuration

After creating OAuth applications:

1. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Go to Django admin: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`

3. Login with your superuser account

4. Configure Site:
   - Go to Sites > example.com
   - Change domain to: `127.0.0.1:8000`
   - Change display name to: `Vinyl Record House`

## üîí Production Deployment Notes

For production deployment:

1. Update redirect URIs in all OAuth applications to use your production domain
